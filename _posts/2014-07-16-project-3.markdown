description: The Alaska City Guide was a magazine created to spotlight low budget options in South Central Alaska. In the guide it highlights the best bars, food, and hikes in the beautiful state. All photography, layout design, typography, and words were created by me. To see the full magazine please visit <a href="https://issuu.com/madisoncranmer/docs/alaskaguide" target="_blank">here</a>
